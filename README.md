Visual Features Processing and Analysis
Overview
This repository contains a Python script for processing and analyzing visual feature data from the DAIC-WOZ dataset. The script performs the following tasks:

Combines and Extracts Visual Features:

Reads and combines multiple text files from a ZIP archive.
Saves the combined data as a CSV file.
Data Analysis:

Loads the combined data.
Computes measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode).
Calculates measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation).
Determines percentiles and quartiles.
Evaluates skewness and kurtosis.
Generates summary statistics.
Visualization:

Creates distribution plots and boxplots for selected features.
